In this project i made my first git push using:
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "discription"
git remote add origin repo.git link
git branch (note your branch name with green color)
// for now users, git will ask you to login using: 
username and email or passowrd
git push origin branchName

for subsequent  push or update on this folder use:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "discription"
git branch
git push origin branchName

if you see a pull request, your files has been uploaded, 
just click on your branch name to fill  the uploaded files
